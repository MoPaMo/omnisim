# omniSIM

I'm building OmniSIM, an eSIM comparison service for my upcoming trip to the Mekong area. It should show users all the different eSIMs availalbe for a region of there choosing, with informations like price per GB, duration etc.

Because of the upcoming high seas deadline, I'm shipping only the static layout for now, without actual eSIM data integrations. 

I took inspiration at Apple product pages with the noisy textures.

Tech Specs:
- NextJS
- tailwind
- shadCN
- custom themes and backgrounds
